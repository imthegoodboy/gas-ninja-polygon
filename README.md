## 🌟 What is PolyGas?

**PolyGas** is a professional, production-ready web application that helps Polygon network users optimize their transaction costs by tracking real-time gas prices and providing intelligent scheduling capabilities. Built for traders, NFT enthusiasts, dApp developers, and anyone who wants to save money on Polygon transactions.

### 💡 Why PolyGas?

The Polygon network's gas prices fluctuate throughout the day. Executing transactions during peak times can cost you **up to 70% more** than off-peak times. PolyGas solves this problem by:

- **Real-time monitoring** of Polygon gas prices (updates every 5 seconds)
- **Smart scheduling** to execute transactions when prices drop
- **AI-powered insights** for optimal transaction timing
- **Historical analytics** to identify patterns and trends
- **Cost estimation** in both Gwei and USD
